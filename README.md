# Covid19 cases in 2019

In this project, as an ADV Python's Assignment, I have tried to visualize the cases in jupyter 
  with pandas, numpy, matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot libraries to analyze such cases.
In the firt part, you see the cases and the others are as follows: deaths, deaths_per_continent, 
  data_clean_country (deleting zero records), data_csv_st (as data which have been sorted by Date), deaths of Zimbabwe, and plot deaths per day.
